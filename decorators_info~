Decorators allow you to inject or modify code in functions or classes. Sounds a bit like Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Java, doesn't it? Except that it's both much simpler and (as a result) much more powerful. For example, suppose you'd like to do something at the entry and exit points of a function (such as perform some kind of security, tracing, locking, etc. -- all the standard arguments for AOP). With decorators, it looks like this:

@entryExit
def func1():
    print "inside func1()"

@entryExit
def func2():
    print "inside func2()"
The @ indicates the application of the decorator.

A function decorator is applied to a function definition by placing it on the line before that function definition begins. For example:

@myDecorator
def aFunction():
    print "inside aFunction"
When the compiler passes over this code, aFunction() is compiled and the resulting function object is passed to the myDecorator code, which does something to produce a function-like object that is then substituted for the original aFunction().

What should the decorator do? Well, it can do anything but usually you expect the original function code to be used at some point. This is not required, however:

class myDecorator(object):

    def __init__(self, f):
        print "inside myDecorator.__init__()"
        f() # Prove that function definition has completed

    def __call__(self):
        print "inside myDecorator.__call__()"

@myDecorator
def aFunction():
    print "inside aFunction()"

print "Finished decorating aFunction()"

aFunction()
When you run this code, you see:

inside myDecorator.__init__()
inside aFunction()
Finished decorating aFunction()
inside myDecorator.__call__()
